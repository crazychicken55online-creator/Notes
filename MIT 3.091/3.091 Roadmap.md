# [Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091sc-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2010/)
# Course Objectives
- **Atomic Structure & Bonding:**  
    Learn how electronic structure determines bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic) and material properties.
- **Periodic Trends & Reactivity:**  
    Use periodic behavior to predict bonding, structure, and compound stability.
- **Crystallography:**  
    Describe crystal systems, Bravais lattices, and Miller indices; relate atomic packing to density and strength.
- **X-Ray Diffraction:**  
    Apply Bragg’s Law to determine crystal structures experimentally.
- **Defects & Diffusion:**  
    Understand point, line, and planar defects; use Fick’s laws to model diffusion.
- **Thermodynamics & Phase Diagrams:**  
    Apply Gibbs free energy and phase diagrams to predict stability and transformations in materials.
- **Kinetics:**  
    Relate temperature and activation energy to reaction and phase transformation rates.
- **Electronic Structure & Band Theory:**  
    Explain conductivity and semiconductors using band structure and doping concepts.
- **Materials Classes & Applications:**  
    Compare metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and biomaterials by structure–property relationships.
