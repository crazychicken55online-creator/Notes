- The instantaneous rate of change of a function is the slope (or rate of change) at a particular point (or instant).
	- It is the same as the change of the derivative value at a specific point.
- For a graph, the rate of change of a function at a specific point is the same as the slope of the tangent line at that particular point.
# Formula for instantaneous rate of change:
$$\begin{array}{l}f'(a) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{[f(a + h) â€“ f(a)]}{h}\end{array}$$
