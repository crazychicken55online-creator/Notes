# Geometric Interpretation of Differentiation
- Problem being addressed: find the tangent line to some function $y=f(x)$ at point $\text{p}=(x_0,y_0)$
> [!example] A graph with secant and tangent lines.

- The derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=x_0$ is the [[Instantaneous Rate of Change|instantaneous rate of change]] of the function $f(x)$ at point $x$. It is also the slope of the tangent line of function $f(x)$ at point $(x_0,f(x_0))$.
	- Note that the tangent line is **NOT** just a line that meets the graph at one point.
	- The tangent line is the [[Limit|limit]] of the secant lines joining points $P=(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $Q$ on the graph of $f(x)$ as $Q$ approaches $P$.
