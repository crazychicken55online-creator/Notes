# Geometric Interpretation of Differentiation
- Problem being addressed: find the tangent line to some function $y=f(x)$ at point $\text{p}=(x_0,y_0)$
> [!example] A graph with secant and tangent lines.

- The derivative of $f(x)$ at $x=x_0$ is the [[Instantaneous Rate of Change|instantaneous rate of change]] of the function $f(x)$ at point $x$. It is also the slope of the tangent line of function $f(x)$ at point $(x_0,f(x_0))$.
	- Note that the tangent line is **NOT** just a line that meets the graph at one point.
	- The tangent line is the [[Limit|limit]] of the secant lines joining points $P=(x_0,f(x_0))$ and $Q$ on the graph of $f(x)$ as $Q$ approaches $P$.

# Finding the equation of the tangent line
- To find the equation of a line tangent to function $f(x)$ at point $(x_0,y_0)$ we need to plug in values to the general line equation:
$$y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$$
- Here:
	- $y$ is the output of the tangent line
	- $x$ is the input of the tangent line
	- $x_0$ is the input of the original function $f(x)$ of which we are finding the tangent line.
	- $y_0$ is the output of that $x_0$ for the original function $f(x)$
	- $m$ is the slope of the function which is the derivative of the original function $f(x)$ at point $(x_0,y_0)$.
