# [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://datastructur.es/)
# Course Objectives
- Learn to implement and use fundamental dynamic data structures such as lists, queues, trees, hash tables, and arrays.  
- Understand algorithmic design and analysis of basic algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching) and how data structure choice affects performance (time/space trade-offs).  
- Gain proficiency with the Java programming language and object-oriented programming techniques.  
- Grasp the distinction between interface (specification) and implementation, abstract data types, encapsulation, and modular software design.  
- Recognize when a particular data structure or algorithm is appropriate for a problem and evaluate its trade-offs.  
- Develop engineering skills to design, build, and maintain larger software systems (on the order of thousands of lines of code).
