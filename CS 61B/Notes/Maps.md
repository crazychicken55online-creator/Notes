In programming languages, a map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is guaranteed to be unique.
Also called:
- Dictionary (in Python).
- Associative Array (in theoretical computer science).
- Symbol Table (occasionally).
- JavaScript objects (when you parse JSON).
E.g., `{"alpha" : "first letter of greek alphabet", "potato" : "a starchy edible plant"}`
