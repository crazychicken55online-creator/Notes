A list is an ordered sequence of objects, often represented by comma-separated values in-between brackets.
E.g., `[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]`
Lists support a variety of operations which vary according to the whims of the authors who wrote the code for the list. Some examples:
- Append an item, e.g., we could append `18` to the list above.
- Retrieve an item by index, e.g., we could ask for the 0th item and get `3`.
- Removing an item by index or by value, e.g., we could remove the `9` from the list.

# Array vs. List
In Java, Arrays are fixed size, Lists are not.
Note that Lists are also abstract data types in Java.
