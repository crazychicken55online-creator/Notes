- The program counter (PC) is a special register in the CPU, that keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed.
- The CPU uses the address in the PC to fetch the next instruction from memory.
- After fetching, the PC is automatically incremented to point to the next instruction.
- The PC is effectively a "next instruction address" tracker.
# Notes about concurrency
- During execution:
	- The program counter (PC) always points to the next instruction of the currently running program.
	- The CPU executes that instruction, updates the PC, and so on.
- When the OS decides to context switch:
	- The OS saves the current CPU state, which includes the PC, general-purpose registers, stack pointer, etc.
	- These values are stored in either the process's PCB (Process Control Block) or temporarily on the kernel stack (depending on implementation).
- The OS then loads another process:
	- It retrieves that process's previously saved PC and registers from its PCB (or kernel stack depending on implementation).
	- It loads those values back into the CPU.
	- Now the CPU's PC points to the next instruction of the new program, and execution continues from there.
