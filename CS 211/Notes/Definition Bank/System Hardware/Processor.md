- Also known as the **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** interprets (executes) instructions stored in main memory.
- At the core of the CPU is a word-size storage device (register) called the [[Program Counter|program counter (PC)]].
- At any point in time the PC points at (contains the address of) some machine-language instruction in main memory.
- A processor operates according to a very simple instruction execution model, which is defined by its **instruction set architecture**.
	- In the above model, instructions execute in a strict sequence, and executing those instructions requires a series of steps.
		- The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the program counter (PC), interprets the bits in the instruction, performs some simple operation dictated by the instruction, and the updates the PC to point to the next instruction.
			- The next instruction may or may not be contiguous in memory to the instruction that was just executed. (Executed in a first come first serve basis, the processor does not care about what it is executing, it just executes what the program counter (PC) tells it to execute).
	- There are only a few of these instructions, which revolve around the main memory, the register file, and the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU).
		- The **register file** is a small storage device that consists of a collection of word-size registers, each with its own unique name. 
		- The **ALU** computes new data and address values.
	- Here are a few simple operations that the CPU may carry out at the request of an instruction:
		- **Load**: Copy a byte or a word from main memory into a register, overwriting the previous contents of the register.
		- **Store**: Copy a byte or a word from a register to a location in main memory, overwriting the previous contents of that location.
		- **Operate**: Copy the contents of two registers to the ALU, perform an arithmetic operation on the two words, and store the result in a register, overwriting the previous contents of that register.
		- **Jump**: Extract a word from the instruction set itself and copy that word into the program counter (PC), overwriting the previous value of the PC.
	- We can distinguish the processor's instruction set architecture from its **microarchitecture**.
