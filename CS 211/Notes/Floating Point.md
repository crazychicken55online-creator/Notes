# Fractional Binary Numbers
- Same as fractional decimal numbers, they're binary representations of fractional numbers and such they include a "binary point". Think of it has how the 0.25 is the decimal representation of the fractional number $\frac{1}{4}$ and has a "decimal point" between 0 and 25.
- Just like how in decimal, digits to the left have weights 1, 10, 100, etc. and digits to the right have weights $\frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{100}, \frac{1}{1000}$, etc. In binary, the bits to the left have weights 1, 2, 4, etc. and the bits to the right have weights $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8},$ etc.
- Note that just like how $\frac{1}{3}$ cannot be represented perfectly in decimal, numbers like $\frac{1}{5}$ cannot be represented perfectly in binary.
