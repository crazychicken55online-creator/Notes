- A single byte consists of 8 bits. In binary notation, its values range from $00000000_2$ to $11111111_2$. When viewed a decimal integer, its values range from $0_{10}$ to $255_{10}$.
	- Binary notation is too verbose, while decimal notation is too tedious to convert back and forth from.
- As a fix for this, we write bit patterns as base-16, or hexadecimal numbers.
