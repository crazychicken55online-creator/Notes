# [Classical Mechanics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/)
# Course Objectives
- Introduce the fundamental concepts of classical mechanics: space, time, mass, force, momentum, torque, and angular momentum.
- Develop conceptual understanding of motion and the ability to describe and predict motion using both force-based and conservation-law approaches.
- Kinematics: straight-line (1D) motion, motion in a plane (2D), and circular motion (position, velocity, acceleration).
- Dynamics: Newton’s laws of motion, contact forces, tension, springs, gravity, resistive (drag) forces, constraints, and continuous systems (e.g., massive ropes).
- Momentum and impulse: linear momentum, conservation of momentum, center of mass motion, mass transfer problems, collisions (elastic & inelastic).
- Energy methods: work, kinetic energy, potential energy, conservation of mechanical energy, energy diagrams, conservative vs non-conservative forces.
- Rotational motion and rigid bodies: motion of a rigid body, moment of inertia, torque, rotational dynamics, angular momentum (point particles and rigid bodies).
- Rolling motion (translation + rotation), gyroscopic motion, and advanced/continuous systems in classical mechanics.
