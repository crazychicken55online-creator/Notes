# Why Linear Algebra
- Data representation/transformation in a vector space (high dimensional)  
- Provides tools to understand the geometric shape of high dimensional data (decorrelation: whitening & data compression: PCA)  
- A linear regression problem can be translated into solving a linear system.  
- Linear Algebra plays a role in every stage of machine learning from (1) data preprocessing to (2) modeling and learning.
## Linear Regression
Linear Regression Model: $𝑎𝑋_1 + 𝑏𝑋_2 + 𝑐𝑋_3 = 𝑌$
𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 can be found by solving the linear system below
