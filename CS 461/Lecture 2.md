# Why Probability?  
## To Measure Uncertainty
We could predict the number on a dice roll if we knew of **every** factor that affects the outcome: the initial grip, angle it was thrown at, air condition, etc.
However, in practice, we have **limited information**. So everything is a guess, therefore probability is needed.
**Probability Theory** helps us use math to understand and measure how uncertain or likely different events are to happen. It’s like a tool that helps us figure out the chances of something happening, even if we’re not completely sure about the outcome.
## Why Probability in Machine Learning?

# Two Interpretation of Probability: Frequentist vs Bayesian 

# Probability Space/Axioms  
# Random Variables/Random Vectors  
# Computing Probability: Joint & Conditional Prob/Marginalization  
# Bayes Rules  
# Important Statistics: mean & variance (random scalar & vectors)  
# Gaussian Density (defined by mean and variance)  
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)  
# Sample mean and Sample Variance
