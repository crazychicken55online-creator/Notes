# What is Data Science
- Data Science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights about real world problems from structured and unstructured data.
The real challenge of data science is interpreting raw data, getting the data is not hard, using it is.
- Raw data is **messy**, **incomplete**, **inconsistent**, and **potentially misleading**. 
## Trivial vs. Non-Trivial Inferences
- Trivial inferences are often descriptive, readily apparent, and are simple to find out.
	- E.g., “Average sales in December were higher than in January.”
- Non-trivial inferences extract hidden patterns, predict future behaviors, or explain *why* something happened, these are often implicit and not obvious at first glance.
	- E.g., Identifying complex patterns of fraudulent activity, such as, a specific non-obvious sequence of card usage.
# Why Python
- Python serves as a “glue” language, usually data scientists would do their analysis in a language like R and then write the code in C or Java, python solves this 2 language problem by being easy to code applications in and do data analysis with, all while being performant.
